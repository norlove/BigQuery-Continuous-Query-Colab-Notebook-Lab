**BigQuery Streaming Reverse ETL into Pub/Sub**

This repository contains a Colab notebook that provides a hands-on example of BigQuery's capability to perform *Streaming Reverse ETL into Pub/Sub*. You'll learn how BigQuery can continuously query data from a source table and stream the results to a Pub/Sub topic in near real-time using a [BigQuery continuous query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/continuous-queries-introduction).
